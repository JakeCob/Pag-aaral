When to Use Tuples vs Lists

  Use tuples when:
  - Data shouldn't change (coordinates, RGB values, database records)
  - You need hashable collections (dictionary keys)
  - You want better performance (tuples are faster than lists)
  - You're returning multiple values from a function

  Use lists when:
  - You need to modify the collection
  - You're building a dynamic collection of items
