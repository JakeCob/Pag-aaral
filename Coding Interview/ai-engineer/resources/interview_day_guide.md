## üí¨ Communication Templates

### Starting Each Section
> "Let me make sure I understand the requirements correctly..."
> (Repeat back what you heard)
> "Should I prioritize [X] or [Y]?"
> "Any specific edge cases you want me to handle?"

### While Coding
> "I'm going to start with the core functionality, then add error handling..."
> "I'm using a doubly-linked list here because it gives O(1) removal..."
> "This is similar to a system I built at [company] where..."

### When Stuck
> "Let me think through this step by step..." (think out loud)
> "I'm considering two approaches: [A] and [B]. [A] is simpler but [B] is more scalable..."
> "Can I ask a clarifying question about [specific requirement]?"

### DON'T Say
- ‚ùå "I don't know" (try: "Let me think through this...")
- ‚ùå "This is hard" (try: "This is interesting, let me break it down...")
- ‚ùå Silent coding for 10+ minutes
- ‚ùå "I've never done this before"

---

## üìã Pre-Coding Checklist

Before writing any code, DO THIS:

1. **Read Requirements Twice**
   - First read: Get overall picture
   - Second read: Note specific requirements

2. **Ask Clarifying Questions** (Write these down beforehand!)
   - "What file formats should I support?"
   - "Should I handle errors or focus on happy path?"
   - "Is performance critical here?"
   - "Should this be production-ready or MVP?"
   - "Any specific libraries I should use?"

3. **Explain Your Approach** (30 seconds)
   - "I'll create 3 classes: DocumentProcessor, VectorStore, and RAG..."
   - "First I'll implement the core logic, then add error handling..."

4. **Start Simple**
   - Core functionality first
   - Error handling second
   - Optimization third (if time)

## ‚ö° Quick Reference: Core Patterns

### Pattern 1: FastAPI Endpoint
```python
@app.post("/query", response_model=QueryResponse)
async def query_document(query: Query):
    try:
        # 1. Validate input
        # 2. Process request
        # 3. Return response
        return QueryResponse(...)
    except HTTPException:
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error: {e}")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

### Pattern 2: Pydantic Models
```python
class Query(BaseModel):
    question: str
    doc_id: str
    max_results: int = Field(default=5, ge=1, le=20)
    use_cache: bool = True
```

### Pattern 3: LRU Node Operations
```python
# Move to front (O(1))
def _move_to_front(self, node):
    if node == self.head:
        return
    self._remove_node(node)
    self._add_to_front(node)

# Evict LRU (O(1))
def _evict_lru(self):
    if self.tail:
        self._remove_node(self.tail)
        del self.cache[self.tail.key]
```

### Pattern 4: Async Parallel Execution
```python
# Execute agents in parallel
tasks = [agent.execute(input) for agent in agents]
results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
```

## üß† Mindset & Stress Management

### Before Interview
- **Deep breathing**: 4-7-8 technique (inhale 4s, hold 7s, exhale 8s)
- **Positive visualization**: See yourself solving problems calmly
- **Affirmations**: "I've prepared well. I know this material. I can do this."

### During Interview
- **If stuck**: Take a breath, think out loud, break problem down
- **If making mistake**: "Actually, let me reconsider that..." (it's okay!)
- **If behind on time**: "I'll implement the core functionality and mention what I'd add with more time"

### Remember
- ‚úÖ They want you to succeed (they're hiring!)
- ‚úÖ It's a conversation, not an interrogation
- ‚úÖ Asking questions shows engagement
- ‚úÖ Explaining your thought process is more important than perfect code
- ‚úÖ You've built production systems before - you know this!
