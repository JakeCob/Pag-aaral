  - [ ] Thread safety
- [ ] **Section 3 (60 min)**: Multi-Agent System
  - [ ] Agent base class + specialized agents

## Day 6 (Jan 6) - Improvements & Production Patterns

### Fix Weak Areas
- [ ] Re-implement areas from Mock #1 that struggled
- [ ] Focus on: ________________________
- [ ] Practice: ________________________

### Production Patterns Review
- [ ] Error handling: Try-except at all boundaries
