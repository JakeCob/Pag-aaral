# Mock Interview #2 - Day 7

**Duration**: 3 hours
**Difficulty**: Simulates actual interview (with variations)
**Goal**: Validate improvements and build confidence

---

## üìã Format (Same Structure, Different Problems)

### Section 1: RAG System (90 minutes)

**Variation**: Different document formats and requirements
- CSV and Markdown support (instead of just TXT/PDF)
- Implement re-ranking with cross-encoder
- Add faithfulness evaluation
- Conversation context with query rewriting

**Focus**: Advanced RAG features you might have skipped in Mock 1

---

### Section 2: Cache System (45 minutes)

**Variation**: Add production features
- Implement statistics tracking (hits, misses, evictions)
- Add serialization support (pickle)
- Implement read-write locks (instead of single lock)
- Performance benchmarking

**Focus**: Production-quality cache implementation

---

### Section 3: Multi-Agent System (60 minutes)

**Variation**: More complex workflow
- Implement 5 specialized agents (instead of 3)
- DAG workflow with parallel execution
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker pattern

**Focus**: Production-grade fault tolerance
